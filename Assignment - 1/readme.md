# Encryption and Decryption Script

This Ruby script allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using a simple algorithm. You can input a message, a key, and choose whether to encrypt or decrypt the message.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have Ruby installed on your system. You can download and install Ruby from [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

3. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.

4. Run the script using the following command:

    ```bash
    ruby assignment.rb
    ```

5. Follow the prompts to input the message, key (an integer), and choose the mode (encrypt or decrypt).

6. After inputting the required information, the script will perform encryption or decryption accordingly and display the result.
